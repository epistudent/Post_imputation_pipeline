# Post imputation pipeline
This pipeline aims to add genotyped SNPs that get thrown out due to their absence from the reference back into the imputed VCFs post-imputation (specifically, post-imputation with BEAGLE v4 or later)

## Step 1:
- Check list of SNPs to add back (convert between kgp/Illumina SNP names or rsid's as needed)
